The MPLS Dogboarding academy wants to incorporate functionality that allows the HR payroll department to generate a report that breakdown payroll by department.  At the conclusion of the program, the program will generate a report that list the total salary payout for each department.



## Requirements

Construct a program that allows the end-user to input each employee’s name, department number, hourly salary, and number of hours worked.   Within each iteration of entering employee information, display the employee’s name, gross salary and department name.

Once the end-user concludes entering employee data, you will need to output is a list of the seven departments in the company and the total gross payroll (rate times hours) for each department. The department names are shown in the table below.
